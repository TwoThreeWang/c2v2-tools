    "b64_seo_p_what": "Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. It is commonly used to transfer data over media that are designed to deal with textual data.",
    "b64_seo_h2_use": "When to use Base64?",
    "b64_seo_p_use": "Base64 is often used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII. This makes sure that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Common examples include embedding images in HTML/CSS, sending email attachments (MIME), and encoding API credentials.",
    "b64_seo_faq_1_q": "Is Base64 encryption?",
    "b64_seo_faq_1_a": "No, Base64 is NOT encryption. It is an encoding scheme. Encoded data can be easily reversed (decoded) by anyone. It should not be used to secure sensitive data like passwords without additional encryption.",
    "b64_seo_faq_2_q": "Does Base64 increase file size?",
        "b64_seo_faq_2_a": "Yes, Base64 encoding increases the data size by approximately 33%. This is because 3 bytes of binary data are represented by 4 ASCII characters.",
